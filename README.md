An end-to-end automation script using Cypress

1.	First, I set up the Base URL in the cypress.config.js file to ensure consistent test execution.
2.	I encountered a problem when trying to set the season to 2018. The element was not visible due to its parent's CSS property overflow. To bypass this issue, I used the { force: true } option to disable error checking, allowing me to select the desired season.
3.	Initially, I struggled to configure the resolution in cypress.config.js as instructed. However, I found a workaround by placing the cy.viewport(1280, 720) code directly in the assestment.cy.js file. This resolved the issue and set the desired resolution for my test.
4.	One challenge I faced was finding the correct locator to assert the presence of 12 records in the table. After some trial and error, I successfully used cy.get("table tbody tr") to target the table rows and validate their count.
5.	I considered implementing the Page Object Model (POM) for better test organization and maintenance. However, given the relatively small and focused nature of the code, I decided that using POM would introduce unnecessary complexity. Therefore, I opted to keep the code structure straightforward without utilizing the POM pattern.
6.	During the testing process, I encountered flakiness in my test, resulting in an "uncaught:exception" error. To investigate further, I intentionally modified the selector to ensure consistent test failures. While this approach of using Cypress.on("uncaught:exception") to prevent test failures is not recommended due to its drawbacks, it served the purpose of identifying potential issues and maintaining test consistency.
I acknowledge that relying on this approach to handle uncaught exceptions has limitations, such as potentially masking real issues and making debugging more challenging.
